The Forgotten Edge

Version: 0.1
Author: Secretum Nexum

Overview

The Forgotten Edge is a small, lore-friendly content mod for Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

It restores and expands upon Perdue’s forgotten short sword, turning it into a meaningful weapon path that spans both games. What begins as a modest blade in BG1 can later be reforged by Cromwell in BG2 into a deadly weapon of acid and shadow.

The mod is designed to feel like a natural extension of existing content, without disrupting balance or narrative flow.
