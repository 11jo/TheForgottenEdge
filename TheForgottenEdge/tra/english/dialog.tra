// BG1
@2000 = ~Perdue… about this blade. I’ve seen it before.~
@2001 = ~Aye… that’s my old sword. But not as it was. The balance is cleaner, the edge keener—and there’s a bite to it I don’t like.
Whatever you did… you made it mean. Keep it away from me.~
@2002 = ~I’ll keep that in mind.~
@2003 = ~Perdue's Short Sword

Perdue refused to take back her sword. No matter, it seems to be of very good quality.~

// BG2
@3000 = ~About this blade…~
@3001 = ~Hah… Perdue’s blade, is it? Light in the hand. And that bite of yours… acid, I’d wager.
I could temper it proper—make it sing.~
@3002 = ~No, I don't think so. Anything else of use?~
@3003 = ~Bring me five potions o’ invisibility, five potions o’ speed… and 5,000 gold.
Leave it with me a day, and I’ll give you something worth the steel.~
//@3005 = ~There. Balanced, hardened, and mean. Try not to melt your own boots with it.~
@3007 = ~You have potions o’ invisibility, potions o’ speed, don't you? And the sword too. I could temper that blade… Acid, invisibility, and speed, an a nasty brew…~
@3008 = ~What's involved in that?~
@3009 = ~Two things, me friend. It will cost ye 5000 gp for the work, no less, and without an apprentice, ye'll have to stay here a full day and help me run the forge.~
@3010 = ~That sounds fine. Let's do it.~
//@3011 = ~As ye wish. Fer such a commission, we can start on it right away. No sense in wasting time, then... it be best if we just get to it.~
//@3013 = ~Well, there ye go, me friend. Use it well. And if ye comes across anything else of interest, ye knows where to bring it, aye?~
