# The Forgotten Edge

**Version:** 0.1  
**Author:** Secretum Nexum  

---

## Overview

*The Forgotten Edge* is a small, lore-friendly content mod for  
**Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition** and **Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition**.

It restores and expands upon Perdue’s forgotten short sword, turning it into a meaningful weapon path that spans both games. What begins as a modest blade in BG1 can later be reforged by Cromwell in BG2 into a deadly weapon of acid and shadow.

The mod is designed to feel like a natural extension of existing content, without disrupting balance or narrative flow.

-   The weapon’s progression is deliberately restrained to avoid overshadowing iconic items.
    
-   All dialogue additions respect existing character tone and narrative context.
